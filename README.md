# ChimeLat - a pretty neat LimeChat theme

So, yeah, it's my limechat theme. Besides looking pretty neat, it does
these nifty things:

* users get one out of 16 colors and retain that color through the chat
* channels in the log get that same feature

This makes it way easier to use the all channels log, not to mention
viewing the channel log.

It also has log functions 'n stuff. I was able to hit the ground running
on how the hell to do any of this thanks to Ryan Florence and his
limechat limescrips. [Check them out](https://github.com/rpflorence/limescripts). 

To use it, clone the files and place them in your Themes directory. This
is *probably* `~/Library/Application Support/LimeChat/Themes` but in
case it isn't, open LimeChat's preferences and open it in Finder in the
Theme tab. 

Just make sure all three files (the `yaml`, `js` and `css`) are in the
`Theme` directory, open preferences and then you can select the theme.
